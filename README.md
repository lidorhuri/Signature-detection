# Project Overview: Signature Authentication System

 Introduction
 This project introduces a signature authentication system that leverages a React-Native application, a NodeJS server, and multiple Python services to create a robust signature verification process. The system is designed to learn from the user's unique signature characteristics during registration and use this information to verify identity during login attempts.
